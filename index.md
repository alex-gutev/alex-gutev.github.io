# Alexander Gutev

I'm a software developer and have written a couple of open source
projects.

The following is a portfolio of my projects.

## Applications

- [**NuCommander**](/nucommander-gtk) - A fast small orthodox file
  manager.

  _Still a work in progress, however the first release is coming
  soon._

## Programming Languages

- [**Tridash**](http://github.com/alex-gutev/tridash) - A programming
  language based on bindings.

  Releases available however the documentation and tutorials are still
  a work in progress.


## Common Lisp Utilities

Common Lisp is my go to language for experimenting with new
ideas. I've written a number of utilities which are mostly aimed at
enhancing the language and rectifying its deficiencies.

- [**generic-cl**](https://github.com/alex-gutev/generic-cl)

  A library which provides an extensible generic function interface to
  standard Common Lisp functions which are currently not implemented
  as generic functions. This includes comparison functions, arithmetic
  functions and sequence operations.

  _Still in early stages of development._

- [**static-dispatch**](https://github.com/alex-gutev/static-dispatch)

  A library which allows methods of Common Lisp generic functions to
  be chosen at compile-time (based on compile-time type declarations)
  rather than at runtime.

- [**cl-environments**](https://github.com/alex-gutev/cl-environments)

  A cross-implementation library for obtaining information about the
  lexical environment, such as the variable bindings, function
  bindings and type declarations which are in effect, from within
  macros and compiler-macros.
